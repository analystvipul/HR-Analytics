# HR-Analytics


📊 Excited to share the latest project I've been learning on as a Data Analyst! 🚀

🔍 I've developed an insightful HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, shedding light on key trends and insights within our workforce.

📈 From extracting extensive data from Excel to implementing advanced data cleaning techniques, this project has been a journey of transforming raw data into actionable insights.

📊 The dashboard features various visualizations, including:

📊 Card charts showcasing employee counts, average age, and average salaries.

📈 Attrition analysis by age using bar charts.

🍩 Attrition breakdown by education level with donut charts.

📈 Attrition trends over time by experience level displayed through line charts.

🔍 Through this dashboard, we've gained valuable insights into employee attrition patterns and factors influencing workforce dynamics. These insights will inform strategic HR decisions aimed at enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.
1. Identified factors contributing to high employee turnover, such as lack of career growth opportunities or poor work-life balance.
2. Analyzed demographic data to assess diversity levels and identify areas for improvement in creating an inclusive workplace culture.
3. Utilized data to identify skill gaps among employees and tailor training programs to address those needs, enhancing overall workforce capabilities.
4. Explored correlations between engagement survey results and various factors like job satisfaction, communication effectiveness, and leadership styles to improve employee morale and productivity.
5. Pinpointing factors influencing employee turnover and implementing strategies to enhance retention, such as improving workplace culture or offering development opportunities.
